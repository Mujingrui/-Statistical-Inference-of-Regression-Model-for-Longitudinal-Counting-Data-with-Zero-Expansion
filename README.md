# Statistical-Inference-of-Regression-Model-for-Longitudinal-Counting-Data-with-Zero-Expansion


This paper extended this GEE-type approach to zero-inﬂation count longitudinal data. In this paper, a general
ized estimating equation (GEE)-type mixture model is proposed to jointly model the
response of interest and thezero-inﬂated predictors. The estimates of parameters have
been acquired by constructing estimating equations. In simulation study, this paper
used Monte Carlo method to analyze three diﬀerent classes of response data and got
the results of estimators to verify the reliability of this method.

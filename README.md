# Statistical-Inference-of-Regression-Model-for-Longitudinal-Counting-Data-with-Zero-Expansion


This paper extended this GEE-type approach to zero-inﬂation count longitudinal data. In this paper, a generalized estimating equation (GEE)-type mixture model is proposed to jointly model the response of interest and the zero-inﬂated predictors. The estimates of parameters have been acquired by constructing estimating equations. In simulation study, this paper used Monte Carlo method to analyze three diﬀerent classes of response data and got the results of estimators to verify the reliability of this method.
